The tool indexes input reads and refers to them internally as numbers. In most cases it converts indexes back your read names,
however, some output will refer to your reads by index number (i.e., the subfolders within each reference sequence output folder).
Use the table below to translate index numbers back to your input reads as needed.
		
Index -> Reads:
		
index= 001
Read1= 5M_isoG_1.fq.gz		Path: /mnt/d/Pipeline_project/scriptTest/reads//5M_isoG_1.fq.gz
Read2= 5M_isoG_2.fq.gz		Path: /mnt/d/Pipeline_project/scriptTest/reads//5M_isoG_2.fq.gz
