The pipeline indexes input reads and refers to them internally as numbers. In most cases it converts indexes back your read names,
however, some output will refer to your reads by index number (i.e., the subfolders within each reference sequence output folder).
Refer to the table below to translate index numbers back to your input reads names as needed.
		
Index -> Reads:
		
index= 001
Read1= 500K_mauG_R1.fastq		Path: /mnt/d/Pipeline_project/scriptTest/reads//500K_mauG_R1.fastq
Read2= 500K_mauG_R2.fastq		Path: /mnt/d/Pipeline_project/scriptTest/reads//500K_mauG_R2.fastq
---------------------------------------------
index= 002
Read1= 5M_isoG_1.fq.gz		Path: /mnt/d/Pipeline_project/scriptTest/reads//5M_isoG_1.fq.gz
Read2= 5M_isoG_2.fq.gz		Path: /mnt/d/Pipeline_project/scriptTest/reads//5M_isoG_2.fq.gz
